            <p>Originally studying biology to apply for medical school, I discovered
               my love for coding late into my undergraduate studies by way of an
               elective programming course. Deciding to finish my studies in biology
               while also pursuing my new-found interest in coding, I completed my
               bachelor's degree in biology in May 2016 before transferring to a new
               school to earn a degree in computer science. Since then I have been
               studying and learning as much as I can on my own while looking for
               new opportunities to better myself as a programmer.</p>
               <br>
            <p>As an employee, I can provide commitment, hard work, and
               self-sufficiency towards a project, as well as a willingness and
               ability to quickly learn new topics on my own. As a programmer,
               I have experience with several languages. Primarily I have focused
               on <span style="">Java</span>, <span style="">
               JavaScript</span>, <span style="">HTML</span>, and
               <span style="">CSS</span>, but I have experience with
               <span style="">C++</span>, <span style="">
               Python</span>, and  <span style="">VBA for Excel</span>.
               My main interest is in full-stack web development using
               <span style="">MEAN</span>, but I also have
               interest and knowledge in computer architecture, object-oriented
               programming and design, and cybersecurity. </p>
               <br>
            <p>As someone who has pursued many topics during their education, I have
               a passion for learning that I bring to every new topic and opportunity.</p>
