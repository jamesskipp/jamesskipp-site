Well it looks like a swing and a miss on my initial implementation of 'postnote'. Turns out reading the creation and edit times with Node file system is not such a reliable method to determine when I wrote or edited a blog post. It’s back to the drawing board, I guess. My new approach will probably involve sending information about my posts from my computer to a MongoDB database. Then I’ll pull that info from my web app and display it here. For now, though, I’m going to have to deal with the displayed times being very wrong. Hopefully I can find some time in the next week to modify my code.
