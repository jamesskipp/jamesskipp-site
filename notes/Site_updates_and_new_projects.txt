I've just updated the site for the first time in a few weeks. I've added info about some of the projects I've been working on over the last few weeks. That includes a chat app that I finished using Node.js, Express, and SocketIO. Also, I began migrating my old jQuery front-end for the MetaNews project into a new Angular 5 CLI project. I've also made progress on some projects I've mentioned on here previously. Stay tuned.
