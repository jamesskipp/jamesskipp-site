PostNote is going well. I've decided to split it up into two parts. The first is a command line interface, and the second is a REST API connected to the database of notes. The CLI will allow a user to sign in and make requests to the REST API to manage the notes they have in the database. Posting notes should be as easy as supplying a directory path to a folder of notes. Obviously the REST API half of the project is going to handle those requests as they come from the CLI. I have some basic use cases completed for the CLI and API, but presently can only post notes to the database.
