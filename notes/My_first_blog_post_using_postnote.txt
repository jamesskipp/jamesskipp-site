This is my first blog post. It is a test to see if everything is working correctly. I made a small plugin that allows me to create a blog post from a text document with the title of the form Blog_Post_Title_With_Underscores_For_Spaces_.txt and then the contents of the blog post are the contents of the text file. The postnote.js script returns the title and body in JSON form so that it can be easily injected with templating. I'm hoping to make the plugin a little bit more robust so that I can publish it on npm. That means I need to add more asynchronous functionality, and more error handling.
